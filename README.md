# â™» E-Waste Image Classifier

This project uses deep learning to classify electronic waste into various categories such as Battery, Mobile, PCB, and more. The goal is to assist in better waste management and recycling using image-based classification.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

The rapid rise in electronic waste (e-waste) poses a significant environmental threat. Automating the classification of e-waste items can support recycling centers in sorting waste efficiently.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Classify e-waste images into one of 10 predefined categories
- Achieve high classification accuracy using transfer learning
- Develop a reusable, scalable deep learning solution

---

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset Description

The dataset consists of labeled images across 10 e-waste categories:

- Battery  
- Mobile  
- Mouse  
- Keyboard  
- PCB (Printed Circuit Board)  
- Printer  
- Microwave  
- Washing Machine  
- Player (audio/video)  
- Television

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Base Model | EfficientNetV2B0 (pretrained on ImageNet) |
| Global Average Pooling | Reduces dimensions |
| Dense (128 units) | ReLU activation |
| Dropout (0.3) | Prevents overfitting |
| Dense (10 units) | Softmax output |

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

| Metric              | Value   |
|---------------------|---------|
| Training Accuracy   | ~99.4%  |
| Validation Accuracy | ~97.6%  |
| Validation Loss     | ~0.12   |
